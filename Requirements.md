# Software Requirements

## Vision
Our vision is to create an app that can transcribe handwritten text into machine readable text. 

The pain point it is solving is to store handwritten notes for document management. 

One should care about our product because it can help people who prefer to learn through handwriting and the 
muscle memory that provides, while being able to easily store and reference those notes at a later date. 

Text recognition saves time and effort. You can be more productive by taking an image of text rather than transcribing it. Text recognition makes it possible to digitize notes. This digitization allows you to implement quick and easy search. It also reduces paper clutter.


## Scope (In/Out)

In: 
 - Our product will take in images of handwritten text, and digitize it into machine readable text. 
 - Store the Images and the text generated by the application as Notes
 - Display the images and generated text
 - User can perform CRUD operations on their Notes

Out: 
 - User's cannot edit other people's notes
 - No text to speech 


## MVP

- Admins will have CRUD access to all information stored in the application
- Users will be able to CRUD their Notes and some personal info
- Users will be able to upload images to have them be digitized
- Users will be able to view their uploaded images and the corresponding digitized text
- Admins will be able to see User's and their uploaded images/text
- Users will only ever be able to CRUD images they have provided


## Stretch Goals
 - GROUPS
 - User's can create Groups that they will Organize
 - Organizers can send group invites, and recieve invites from users to join the Organizers specific group
 - Organizer's can Remove Notes or Members from their group
 - User's can see any image shared to the group
 - User's can share their notes with any group they are a part of
 - Each group will have its own corresponding page that will show the Organizer, members, and shared notes
